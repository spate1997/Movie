Movie Recommendation System

This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using collaborative filtering techniques.
The system recommends movies to users based on the ratings of similar users. 
The model utilizes memory-based collaborative filtering, specifically user-user similarity, to make predictions about what movies a user may like.
